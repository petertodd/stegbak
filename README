stegbak

About
=====

stegbak is a tool to steganographically hide data, typically backups, within an
encrypted partition. Rather than inefficiently trying to hide data in, say, the
low order bits of media files, stegbak takes the brute force approach of simply
encrypting your data, and hiding it in the free space of a hard drive. At first
glace this seems absurd: everyone knows that encrypted data sticks out like a
sore thumb. However all mainstream OS's now support disk-encryption as a
standard feature. If you encrypt a disk once and fill it up with data without
the key the disk now appears to be filled with random data.

Suppose you now reformat that disk. The master cipher key to that data is
destroyed, and what was once on the disk is now irrecoverable, and still
indistinguishable from random data.

Adding further encrypted data to that drive is now possible without the
existence of the new data being detectable... mostly.


Usage
=====

Don't yet; this software is pre-alpha.

If you do want to forge ahead, you'll need either a standard harddrive, or a
SSD drive *without* TRIM support. If you don't know what that means, google it.

Notably the commands currently only support writing to files, and the previous
existence of files on your disk may be something an analysist can detect.

See HACKING for more information.

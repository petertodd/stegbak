Write security document.


The big one: Implement data hiding outside of the file system. This will work
as follows:

Fill disk with dummy blocks:

    stegbak prepare /dev/disk

Format disk as an encrypted drive, put non-sensitive data on it.

Hide now scans disk for dummy blocks that haven't been overwritten yet, and
hides the data in those blocks:

    stegbak hide /dev/disk

Find works as before:

    stegbak find /dev/disk
